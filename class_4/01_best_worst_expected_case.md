Let’s break down the **best case**, **worst case**, and **expected case** for an array of 5 variables with an example algorithm: **Linear Search**. This algorithm is used to find a specific value in the array by checking each element one by one.

---

### **The Setup**
We have an array of 5 variables:
\[
\text{arr} = [3, 7, 2, 9, 5]
\]
Our task is to find a specific value, \( x \), in this array.

---

### **1. Best Case**
- **Definition**: The best-case scenario is when the algorithm performs the **minimum amount of work** to achieve its goal.
- **Linear Search Best Case**: The value \( x \) is found in the **first position** of the array.

#### Example:
- \( x = 3 \) (the first element in the array).
- The algorithm checks the first element and finds \( x \).
- **Steps Taken**: 1 comparison.
- **Time Complexity**: \( \Omega(1) \) (constant time).

---

### **2. Worst Case**
- **Definition**: The worst-case scenario is when the algorithm performs the **maximum amount of work** to achieve its goal.
- **Linear Search Worst Case**: The value \( x \) is not in the array, or it is in the **last position**.

#### Example 1 (Value Not Found):
- \( x = 10 \) (not in the array).
- The algorithm checks all 5 elements and doesn’t find \( x \).
- **Steps Taken**: 5 comparisons.
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n = 5 \).

#### Example 2 (Value in the Last Position):
- \( x = 5 \) (last element in the array).
- The algorithm checks all 5 elements before finding \( x \).
- **Steps Taken**: 5 comparisons.
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \).

---

### **3. Expected Case (Average Case)**
- **Definition**: The expected case assumes the value \( x \) is equally likely to appear in any position of the array (or not at all). It calculates the **average amount of work** the algorithm does.

#### Linear Search Expected Case:
- On average, \( x \) could be found:
  1. At the **1st position** (1 comparison).
  2. At the **2nd position** (2 comparisons).
  3. At the **3rd position** (3 comparisons).
  4. At the **4th position** (4 comparisons).
  5. At the **5th position** (5 comparisons).
  6. **Not found** (5 comparisons).

- **Average Steps**:
  \[
  \text{Average Comparisons} = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 5}{6} = \frac{20}{6} \approx 3.33
  \]

- **Time Complexity**: \( \Theta(n) \), where \( n = 5 \).

### **Summary Table**

| **Case**       | **Condition**                 | **Steps Taken**    | **Time Complexity** |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Best Case**   | \( x \) is the first element  | 1 comparison       | \( \Omega(1) \)     |
| **Worst Case**  | \( x \) is the last element or not found | 5 comparisons | \( O(n) \)          |
| **Expected Case** | \( x \) could be anywhere or not found | ~3.33 comparisons | \( \Theta(n) \)      |

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Best Case**: The algorithm performs the least amount of work (e.g., finding \( x \) immediately).
- **Worst Case**: The algorithm performs the most work (e.g., checking every element).
- **Expected Case**: The average work the algorithm performs, assuming all scenarios are equally likely.

This analysis helps us understand how the algorithm behaves in different situations!
