The **front** and **rear** pointers in a queue are used to keep track of the positions where elements are added (enqueued) and removed (dequeued). These pointers are incremented (increased) as elements are added or removed to ensure the queue behaves according to the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle.

### **Why do the front and rear pointers increase?**

1. **Rear Pointer:**
   - The `rear` pointer is used to track the position where the next element will be added (enqueued).
   - When an element is added to the queue, the `rear` pointer needs to move forward to the next position so that the new element is placed at the end of the queue.

   **Why increase the `rear`?**
   - The `rear` pointer is incremented to ensure that the new element is added to the **next available space** in the queue, maintaining the FIFO order.

   Example:
   - After enqueueing `10`, the `rear` points to index `0`.
   - After enqueueing `20`, the `rear` points to index `1`, and so on.

2. **Front Pointer:**
   - The `front` pointer is used to track the position of the element that will be removed (dequeued) next.
   - When an element is removed from the queue, the `front` pointer moves forward to the next position so that the next element can be accessed.

   **Why increase the `front`?**
   - The `front` pointer is incremented to ensure that the **oldest element** (the one that has been in the queue the longest) is removed first, preserving the FIFO principle.
   - After an element is removed, the `front` pointer moves to the next element, making the queue's remaining elements accessible.

   Example:
   - After dequeueing `10`, the `front` pointer moves to index `1` (the next element in line).

### **How the pointers increase:**

- **Enqueue Operation (Adding elements):**
  - When an element is added, the `rear` pointer increases to point to the next available position.
  - If `rear` reaches the end of the array (i.e., `MAX - 1`), the queue is full, and no more elements can be added unless the queue is a **circular queue** (which wraps around).

- **Dequeue Operation (Removing elements):**
  - When an element is removed, the `front` pointer increases to point to the next element in the queue.
  - If `front` becomes greater than `rear`, it indicates the queue is empty, and the pointers are reset (usually to `-1`).

### **Example Walkthrough:**

Letâ€™s walk through an example where we enqueue and dequeue elements:

1. **Initial Queue**:
   ```
   Queue: [empty, empty, empty, empty, empty]
   front = -1
   rear = -1
   ```

2. **Enqueue 10**:
   - The `rear` pointer moves from `-1` to `0`, and `10` is added to the queue.
   ```
   Queue: [10, empty, empty, empty, empty]
   front = 0
   rear = 0
   ```

3. **Enqueue 20**:
   - The `rear` pointer moves from `0` to `1`, and `20` is added to the queue.
   ```
   Queue: [10, 20, empty, empty, empty]
   front = 0
   rear = 1
   ```

4. **Dequeue (Remove 10)**:
   - The `front` pointer moves from `0` to `1`, and `10` is removed.
   ```
   Queue: [empty, 20, empty, empty, empty]
   front = 1
   rear = 1
   ```

5. **Enqueue 30**:
   - The `rear` pointer moves from `1` to `2`, and `30` is added to the queue.
   ```
   Queue: [empty, 20, 30, empty, empty]
   front = 1
   rear = 2
   ```

### **Why do the pointers need to increase?**
- **Maintaining FIFO**: The primary purpose of the `front` and `rear` pointers is to ensure that elements are processed in the correct order (FIFO). The `rear` pointer keeps track of where new elements should be added, while the `front` pointer ensures that the oldest element is always removed first.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: By moving the `front` and `rear` pointers, we efficiently manage the memory of the queue. This prevents overwriting elements and helps us track the available space.

### **Conclusion**
- The **rear** pointer increases during enqueue operations to add new elements to the queue.
- The **front** pointer increases during dequeue operations to remove elements from the front.
- Both pointers increase to ensure that the queue follows the FIFO principle and operates efficiently, without overwriting or losing track of elements.
