Let's analyze the **time complexity** of the given function `func1` step by step:

---

### **Code Analysis**
```c
void func1(int array[], int length)
{
    int sum = 0;
    int product = 1;

    // Loop 1: Summing the elements
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
    {
        sum += array[i];
    }

    // Loop 2: Multiplying the elements
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
    {
        product *= array[i];
    }
}
```

---

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

#### **1. First Loop**
```c
for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
{
    sum += array[i];
}
```
- This loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = length - 1`, performing one addition operation in each iteration.
- Total number of iterations: \( \text{length} \), i.e., \( n \).
- Time complexity of this loop: \( O(n) \).

---

#### **2. Second Loop**
```c
for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
{
    product *= array[i];
}
```
- This loop also iterates from `i = 0` to `i = length - 1`, performing one multiplication operation in each iteration.
- Total number of iterations: \( \text{length} \), i.e., \( n \).
- Time complexity of this loop: \( O(n) \).

---

#### **3. Combining the Loops**
- Both loops are independent and **not nested**. 
- The time complexity of the function is the sum of the complexities of both loops:
  \[
  O(n) + O(n) = O(2n)
  \]
- In asymptotic analysis, we drop constants, so the time complexity becomes:
  \[
  O(n)
  \]

---

### **Final Answer**
The **time complexity** of the `func1` function is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the value of `length` (the size of the input array).

---

### **Explanation in Simple Terms**
- The function processes the array twice: once for summing and once for multiplying.
- Each operation takes \( n \) steps, where \( n \) is the size of the array.
- Since the two loops are separate (not nested), their complexities are added.
- Constants (like the 2 in \( O(2n) \)) are ignored in Big O notation, so the final complexity is \( O(n) \).
