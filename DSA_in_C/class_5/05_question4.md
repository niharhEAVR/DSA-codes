Let's analyze the **runtime** of the given code for summing the values of all the nodes in a **balanced binary search tree**.

### **Code Analysis**
```c
int sum(Node node)
{
    if (node == NULL)    // Base case: if the node is NULL, return 0
    {
        return 0;
    }
    return sum(node.left) + node.value + sum(node.right);  // Recursive calls for left and right subtrees
}
```

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

1. **Base Case:**
   - If the node is `NULL`, the function returns 0. This is a constant-time operation, \( O(1) \).

2. **Recursive Case:**
   - The function recursively calls `sum(node.left)` and `sum(node.right)` for the left and right subtrees of the current node.
   - It also adds the value of the current node (`node.value`), which is a constant-time operation, \( O(1) \).

### **Total Work Done:**
- The function traverses the entire binary tree, visiting each node exactly once.
- For each node, it performs a constant amount of work (adding the node's value and making two recursive calls).
  
### **Tree Structure:**
- The tree is a **balanced binary search tree**, meaning that the height of the tree is \( O(\log n) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the tree.
- A balanced tree has two subtrees at each node, so the function explores both subtrees recursively.

### **Time Complexity Analysis:**
- The function visits each node once and performs constant work at each node (the addition and the recursive calls).
- Therefore, the total time complexity is proportional to the number of nodes in the tree.

Let the number of nodes in the tree be \( n \). The time complexity is:

\[
T(n) = O(n)
\]

### **Final Answer:**
The **runtime** of the `sum` function is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the binary search tree. This is because the function performs a depth-first traversal of the tree, visiting each node once.
