This code defines a **custom dynamic array structure** in C, allowing you to manage memory efficiently for storing integers. It provides the ability to reserve memory (`total_size`) and track how much of that memory is actually used (`used_size`). Let’s break it down **line by line** and explain everything in detail, including the use of `->`.

---

### **Code Explanation:**

#### **1. `#include <stdio.h>`**
- The **`stdio.h`** header file is included to use standard input and output functions like `printf` or `scanf`.
- Although this code doesn't use these functions, it's common to include this header in programs where debugging or user interaction might be added later.

---

#### **2. `#include <stdlib.h>`**
- The **`stdlib.h`** header file is included to use functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, `free`, etc., for **dynamic memory allocation**.
- In this code, `malloc` is used to allocate memory for the array dynamically.

---

#### **3. `struct myArray`**
```c
struct myArray {
    int total_size; // memory to be reserved
    int used_size;  // memory that actually used
    int *ptr;       // pointer to the first element of the array
};
```
- This defines a structure named **`myArray`**, which is a blueprint for creating objects that represent a dynamic array.
- **`int total_size`**: The total memory (in terms of the number of integers) that will be allocated for the array.
- **`int used_size`**: The number of integers currently being used in the array.
- **`int *ptr`**: A pointer to the memory location where the array is stored.

> Think of this structure as a way to manage both the **capacity** and the **current usage** of a dynamic array.

---

#### **4. `void createArray(struct myArray *a, int tSize, int uSize)`**
```c
void createArray(struct myArray *a, int tSize, int uSize) {
    a->total_size = tSize;
    a->used_size = uSize;
    a->ptr = (int *)malloc(tSize * sizeof(int));
}
```
This is a function to initialize the dynamic array. Let’s break it down:

1. **`struct myArray *a`**:
   - A pointer to a `myArray` structure is passed to this function. This allows the function to modify the structure directly (using pointers).

2. **`int tSize`**:
   - This is the total size (capacity) of the array, specifying how many integers' worth of memory should be allocated.

3. **`int uSize`**:
   - This is the number of elements that are currently being used. It must not exceed `tSize`.

4. **Inside the function:**
   - **`a->total_size = tSize;`**:
     - The `total_size` field of the structure is set to `tSize`.
     - The `->` operator is used to access the members of a structure through a pointer.
   - **`a->used_size = uSize;`**:
     - The `used_size` field is set to `uSize`.
   - **`a->ptr = (int *)malloc(tSize * sizeof(int));`**:
     - Memory is dynamically allocated for the array using `malloc`.
     - `malloc(tSize * sizeof(int))` reserves enough memory for `tSize` integers.
     - The `(int *)` casts the returned `void *` pointer from `malloc` to an `int *`.

---

#### **5. `int main()`**
```c
int main() {
    struct myArray marks;
    createArray(&marks, 100, 20);
    return 0;
}
```
- **`struct myArray marks;`**:
  - Creates an instance of the `myArray` structure named `marks`.
  - This object will store information about the array (capacity, usage, and pointer to the array).

- **`createArray(&marks, 100, 20);`**:
  - Calls the `createArray` function, passing the address of `marks` (`&marks`) to initialize it.
  - Allocates memory for 100 integers and sets the `used_size` to 20.

---

### **What is `->`?**

The **`->` operator** is used to access members of a structure when you have a pointer to that structure.

#### **How it works:**
- Suppose you have a structure:
  ```c
  struct myArray arr;
  ```
- You can access its members directly using the `.` operator:
  ```c
  arr.total_size = 100;
  ```

- But if you have a pointer to the structure:
  ```c
  struct myArray *ptr = &arr;
  ```
- You cannot use `.` directly because `ptr` is a pointer. Instead, use `->`:
  ```c
  ptr->total_size = 100;
  ```

The **`ptr->member`** is equivalent to **`(*ptr).member`**, but `->` is more concise and readable.

---

### **Why is This Code Important?**

1. **Dynamic Memory Management:**
   - This code demonstrates how to dynamically allocate memory for an array.
   - Unlike static arrays, dynamic arrays can grow or shrink as needed, making them more flexible.

2. **Custom Data Structure:**
   - It creates a reusable structure (`myArray`) that can manage arrays efficiently by keeping track of capacity and usage.

3. **Efficient Use of Resources:**
   - By separating `total_size` and `used_size`, the code ensures that memory is not wasted, and operations like resizing can be implemented easily.

---

### **What Can Be Done Next?**

You can expand this code to:
1. Add elements to the array (updating `used_size`).
2. Remove elements.
3. Resize the array if `used_size` exceeds `total_size`.

Let’s visualize how the code works step by step, focusing on the structure, memory allocation, and operations.

---

### **Step 1: Declaring the `myArray` Structure**

```c
struct myArray {
    int total_size; // memory to be reserved
    int used_size;  // memory that actually used
    int *ptr;       // pointer to the first element of the array
};
```

#### Visualization:
- Think of this structure as a **container** for managing a dynamic array.
- It has three parts:
  1. `total_size`: Represents the **total capacity** of the array (how much memory is reserved).
  2. `used_size`: Represents how much of the allocated memory is actually being used.
  3. `ptr`: A pointer that will point to the **starting address** of the dynamically allocated array.

---

### **Step 2: Memory Layout Before Initialization**

Before calling `createArray`, the memory for `marks` is allocated but uninitialized.

#### Visualization:
```
[marks]
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| total_size (??) | used_size (??)  | ptr (NULL/??)   |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
```
- `total_size` and `used_size` have garbage values.
- `ptr` is uninitialized (random or `NULL`).

---

### **Step 3: Calling `createArray`**

```c
createArray(&marks, 100, 20);
```

1. **Passing `&marks`:**
   - The address of the `marks` structure is passed to the function.
   - Inside `createArray`, `a` points to `marks`.

2. **Setting `total_size` and `used_size`:**
   - `a->total_size = tSize;` sets `marks.total_size = 100`.
   - `a->used_size = uSize;` sets `marks.used_size = 20`.

3. **Allocating Memory with `malloc`:**
   - `a->ptr = (int *)malloc(tSize * sizeof(int));` allocates memory for 100 integers.
   - `malloc` returns the address of the allocated memory, which is stored in `marks.ptr`.

#### Visualization After Initialization:
```
[marks]
+-----------------+-----------------+------------------+
| total_size (100)| used_size (20)  | ptr (0xABCD1234) |
+-----------------+-----------------+------------------+

[memory allocated by malloc]
0xABCD1234 -> [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] ... (100 slots)
```
- `marks.ptr` points to the starting address of the allocated memory (`0xABCD1234`).
- The memory allocated by `malloc` is uninitialized, so it contains garbage values.

---

### **Step 4: How Does `->` Work?**

When you use `a->member` inside `createArray`:
1. `a` is a pointer to the structure `marks`.
2. `->` dereferences the pointer (`*a`) and accesses the member directly.

For example:
- `a->total_size = tSize;` is equivalent to `(*a).total_size = tSize;`.

---

### **Step 5: After the Function Call**

After `createArray` finishes, the structure `marks` is fully initialized and ready to use.

#### Visualization:
```
[marks]
+-----------------+-----------------+------------------+
| total_size (100)| used_size (20)  | ptr (0xABCD1234) |
+-----------------+-----------------+------------------+

[memory allocated by malloc]
0xABCD1234 -> [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ] ... (100 slots)
```

- You can now use the `marks.ptr` array to store up to 100 integers.
- Only the first 20 slots are considered "used" (`used_size`), but the rest of the slots are available for future use.

---

### **How It Works Together**

1. **Structure:**
   - `marks` keeps track of the array’s capacity (`total_size`), usage (`used_size`), and memory location (`ptr`).

2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**
   - `malloc` allocates memory on the heap for `total_size` integers.
   - This memory can grow or shrink dynamically, unlike static arrays.

3. **Pointer Operations:**
   - `->` allows accessing the structure’s members directly through a pointer.

---

### **Real-Life Analogy**

Imagine you’re managing a **parking lot**:
1. **`total_size`**:
   - The total number of parking spaces available (100 spaces).
2. **`used_size`**:
   - The number of spaces currently occupied (20 spaces).
3. **`ptr`**:
   - A map showing where the parking lot starts.

When you call `createArray`, it’s like building the parking lot, setting its capacity (`total_size`), marking how many spaces are used (`used_size`), and creating a map (`ptr`) to manage it.

---

### **What Happens If You Use the Array?**

You can now use `marks.ptr` to store values.

```c
marks.ptr[0] = 10;  // Store 10 in the first slot
marks.ptr[1] = 20;  // Store 20 in the second slot
```

#### Visualization After Adding Values:
```
[marks.ptr]
0xABCD1234 -> [ 10 ] [ 20 ] [ ? ] [ ? ] ... (100 slots)
```

---

### **What Happens If You Exceed `total_size`?**

If you try to store more than `total_size` elements:
```c
marks.ptr[100] = 999;  // Undefined behavior!
```
- This leads to **undefined behavior** because the memory beyond the allocated size (100 integers) is not reserved.

To handle this, you would need to resize the array using `realloc`.
