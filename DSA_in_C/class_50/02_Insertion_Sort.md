### **Insertion Sort**

**Insertion Sort** is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that works by building a sorted portion of the array one element at a time. It picks each element from the unsorted portion and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted portion.

---

### **How It Works**

1. Start with the second element (index 1) as the "key."
2. Compare the key with the elements before it (from right to left in the sorted portion).
3. Shift all elements greater than the key one position to the right.
4. Insert the key into its correct position.
5. Repeat this process for all elements in the array.

---

### **Algorithm**
1. Start with the second element (`arr[1]`) as the key.
2. Compare it with elements before it and shift them if they are greater than the key.
3. Insert the key into the correct position.
4. Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

---

### **Example in C**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void insertionSort(int arr[], int n) {
    int i, key, j;
    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        key = arr[i];
        j = i - 1;

        // Move elements that are greater than key to one position ahead
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = key; // Insert the key
    }
}

void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6,56,2,5,87,3,7,3,7,9,3,23,7,8,4};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    printf("Unsorted array: ");
    printArray(arr, n);

    insertionSort(arr, n);

    printf("Sorted array: ");
    printArray(arr, n);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Text Visualization**
Sorting the array `{12, 11, 13, 5, 6}` using Insertion Sort:

---

### **Unsorted Array:**  
`12 11 13 5 6`

---

### **Pass 1:**  
- Key = `11`  
- Compare `11` with `12`: Shift `12` to the right → `_ 12 13 5 6`  
- Insert `11` in its correct position → `11 12 13 5 6`  

**Array after Pass 1:**  
`11 12 13 5 6`

---

### **Pass 2:**  
- Key = `13`  
- Compare `13` with `12`: No shift needed → `11 12 13 5 6`  

**Array after Pass 2:**  
`11 12 13 5 6`

---

### **Pass 3:**  
- Key = `5`  
- Compare `5` with `13`: Shift `13` → `11 12 _ 13 6`  
- Compare `5` with `12`: Shift `12` → `11 _ 12 13 6`  
- Compare `5` with `11`: Shift `11` → `_ 11 12 13 6`  
- Insert `5` in its correct position → `5 11 12 13 6`  

**Array after Pass 3:**  
`5 11 12 13 6`

---

### **Pass 4:**  
- Key = `6`  
- Compare `6` with `13`: Shift `13` → `5 11 12 _ 13`  
- Compare `6` with `12`: Shift `12` → `5 11 _ 12 13`  
- Compare `6` with `11`: Shift `11` → `5 _ 11 12 13`  
- Compare `6` with `5`: No shift needed → `5 6 11 12 13`  

**Array after Pass 4:**  
`5 6 11 12 13`

---

### **Sorted Array:**  
`5 6 11 12 13`

---

### **Key Observations**
1. Each pass processes one element and places it in its correct position.
2. The sorted portion grows with each pass.
3. Insertion Sort is efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.

---

### **Time Complexity**
- **Best Case:** \(O(n)\) (already sorted array).  
- **Worst Case:** \(O(n^2)\) (reverse sorted array).  

### **Space Complexity**
- \(O(1)\) (in-place sorting).

### **Key Differences Between Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort**

| **Aspect**                | **Bubble Sort**                                                                                     | **Insertion Sort**                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Working Mechanism**     | Compares adjacent elements and repeatedly swaps them if they are in the wrong order.               | Inserts each element into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.             |
| **Number of Comparisons** | Makes comparisons for all pairs of adjacent elements, even if the array is already sorted.          | Stops comparisons as soon as the correct position for the current element is found.               |
| **Number of Swaps**       | Performs many swaps, even if the array is nearly sorted.                                            | Minimizes swaps by shifting elements instead of swapping them.                                     |
| **Efficiency**            | Less efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays because of unnecessary swaps.                     | More efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays due to fewer comparisons and swaps.              |
| **Best Case Complexity**  | \(O(n^2)\) (no optimization for already sorted arrays without additional logic).                   | \(O(n)\) (if the array is already sorted, only one comparison per element is needed).             |
| **Worst Case Complexity** | \(O(n^2)\)                                                                                         | \(O(n^2)\)                                                                                         |
| **Stability**             | Stable (maintains the relative order of equal elements).                                            | Stable (maintains the relative order of equal elements).                                            |
| **Use Case**              | Suitable for teaching purposes or very small datasets.                                             | Better for small datasets, nearly sorted arrays, or as a part of more complex algorithms.          |

### **Key Insights**

1. **Number of Operations**:  
   - Bubble Sort often performs more swaps because it keeps checking all adjacent pairs even after parts of the array are sorted.  
   - Insertion Sort minimizes operations by stopping early when the correct position for an element is found.

2. **Behavior with Nearly Sorted Arrays**:  
   - Bubble Sort does not adapt well to nearly sorted arrays and still performs many redundant operations.  
   - Insertion Sort quickly identifies the correct position for elements, making it more efficient for nearly sorted arrays.

3. **Real-World Use**:  
   - Bubble Sort is rarely used in practice due to its inefficiency.  
   - Insertion Sort is more practical and is often used in hybrid algorithms like Timsort for sorting small subarrays.

---

### **Example Comparison**
For an already sorted array like `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`:
- **Bubble Sort** will still compare every pair of elements, resulting in \(O(n^2)\) complexity unless optimized.  
- **Insertion Sort** will detect that no shifting is needed, completing in \(O(n)\) time.

### Real-World Example of **Insertion Sort**

Let’s use a **real-world analogy** to explain **Insertion Sort**: **Sorting playing cards in your hand**.

---

### Scenario:
Imagine you are playing a card game, and you need to arrange the cards in your hand in ascending order.

---

### Steps:

1. **Start with the First Card**:
   - Assume the first card is already sorted.

2. **Pick the Next Card**:
   - Take the next card from the deck and compare it with the cards already in your hand.
   - Place it in the correct position relative to the sorted cards.

3. **Repeat for All Cards**:
   - Continue picking the next card from the deck and inserting it into the correct position in your hand.
   - Each step ensures that the cards in your hand are sorted.

---

### Example:

#### Initial Cards in Hand: `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`

1. **Step 1 (First Card)**:
   - The first card (`64`) is already sorted.

2. **Step 2 (Second Card)**:
   - Take the second card (`25`).
   - Compare it with `64`.
   - Insert `25` before `64`.
   - Hand after Step 2: `[25, 64, 12, 22, 11]`.

3. **Step 3 (Third Card)**:
   - Take the third card (`12`).
   - Compare it with `64` → Move `64` one position to the right.
   - Compare it with `25` → Move `25` one position to the right.
   - Insert `12` at the beginning.
   - Hand after Step 3: `[12, 25, 64, 22, 11]`.

4. **Step 4 (Fourth Card)**:
   - Take the fourth card (`22`).
   - Compare it with `64` → Move `64` one position to the right.
   - Compare it with `25` → Move `25` one position to the right.
   - Insert `22` between `12` and `25`.
   - Hand after Step 4: `[12, 22, 25, 64, 11]`.

5. **Step 5 (Last Card)**:
   - Take the last card (`11`).
   - Compare it with `64`, `25`, `22`, and `12` → Move them all one position to the right.
   - Insert `11` at the beginning.
   - Hand after Step 5: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`.

**Final Sorted Hand**: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`.

---

### Key Points:
1. **Insertion Process**:
   - Each card is inserted into the correct position relative to the sorted portion of the array.

2. **Real-Life Applications**:
   - Sorting a small number of items, like arranging books by height, organizing papers by date, or lining up people by height.
