### Quick Sort in DSA (C Programming)
**Quick Sort** is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It selects a "pivot" element and partitions the array into two subarrays:
1. Elements smaller than the pivot.
2. Elements greater than the pivot.

The process is recursively applied to these subarrays until the entire array is sorted.

---

### How Quick Sort Works
1. **Choose a Pivot**:
   - Select a pivot element (commonly the last element, first element, or a random element).

2. **Partition the Array**:
   - Rearrange the array such that elements smaller than the pivot are on the left and elements greater than the pivot are on the right.
   - Place the pivot in its correct position.

3. **Recursively Sort Subarrays**:
   - Apply the same steps to the left and right subarrays.

---

### Quick Sort Code in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to swap two elements
void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}

// Partition function
int partition(int arr[], int low, int high) {
    int pivot = arr[high]; // Pivot element
    int i = low - 1;       // Index of smaller element

    for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
        if (arr[j] < pivot) { // If the current element is smaller than the pivot
            i++;
            swap(&arr[i], &arr[j]);
        }
    }
    // Place the pivot in its correct position
    swap(&arr[i + 1], &arr[high]);
    return i + 1;
}

// Quick Sort function
void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high) {
    if (low < high) {
        // Partition the array
        int pi = partition(arr, low, high);

        // Recursively sort elements before and after partition
        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
    }
}

// Function to print the array
void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    printf("Original array: \n");
    printArray(arr, n);

    quickSort(arr, 0, n - 1);

    printf("Sorted array: \n");
    printArray(arr, n);

    return 0;
}
```

### Memory Visualization
Quick Sort operates **in-place**, but recursion adds extra memory overhead for function calls.

#### Example Array: `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`

1. **Initial State**:
   - Pivot: `11` (last element).
   - Partition: `[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]`.
   - Pivot is placed in its correct position: `[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]`.

2. **Left Subarray** (`[11]`):
   - Single element, already sorted.

3. **Right Subarray** (`[25, 12, 22, 64]`):
   - Pivot: `64`.
   - Partition: `[25, 12, 22, 64]`.
   - Pivot is placed in its correct position: `[25, 12, 22, 64]`.

4. **Recursive Calls**:
   - Left subarray of `[25, 12, 22]`:
     - Pivot: `22`.
     - Partition: `[12, 22, 25]`.

5. **Final Sorted Array**:
   - `[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`.

---

### Memory Usage
1. **In-Place Sorting**:
   - No extra array is used; swapping is done within the array.
   - Space complexity for the array: \( O(1) \).

2. **Recursive Calls**:
   - Each recursive call adds to the call stack.
   - In the worst case (unbalanced partitioning), the depth of recursion can be \( O(n) \).
   - In the average case (balanced partitioning), the depth is \( O(\log n) \).

---

### Key Points
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Best Case: \( O(n \log n) \) (balanced partitions).
  - Worst Case: \( O(n^2) \) (highly unbalanced partitions, e.g., already sorted array).
  - Average Case: \( O(n \log n) \).
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(\log n) \) for recursive stack calls.
- **Stability**: Not stable (relative order of equal elements may change).

Let's explain **Quick Sort** with a **real-world example** to make it clearer.

---

### Real-World Analogy: Arranging Books on a Shelf
Imagine you have a pile of books with different heights, and you want to arrange them on a shelf in ascending order of height. Quick Sort works like this:

---

### Steps:
1. **Choose a Pivot**:  
   Pick one book from the pile as the **pivot** (e.g., the last book in the pile).

2. **Partition the Books**:  
   Compare each book with the pivot and divide them into two groups:
   - **Left Group**: Books shorter than the pivot.
   - **Right Group**: Books taller than the pivot.

   Place the pivot in its correct position between these two groups.

3. **Repeat for Each Group**:  
   Repeat the same process for the **left group** and **right group** until all groups have only one book (a sorted group).

---

### Example: Sorting Books by Height
#### Initial Heights: `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`

1. **First Step (Choose Pivot)**:
   - Pivot: `11` (last book).
   - Partition:
     - Books shorter than `11`: None.
     - Books taller than `11`: `[64, 25, 12, 22]`.
   - Place `11` in its correct position:
     - Result: `[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]`.

2. **Second Step (Left Group)**:
   - Left group: `[11]` (already sorted).

3. **Second Step (Right Group)**:
   - Right group: `[25, 12, 22, 64]`.
   - Pivot: `64` (last book).
   - Partition:
     - Books shorter than `64`: `[25, 12, 22]`.
     - Books taller than `64`: None.
   - Place `64` in its correct position:
     - Result: `[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]`.

4. **Third Step (Left Group of `[25, 12, 22]`)**:
   - Pivot: `22`.
   - Partition:
     - Books shorter than `22`: `[12]`.
     - Books taller than `22`: `[25]`.
   - Place `22` in its correct position:
     - Result: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`.

5. **Final Step**:
   - Left group: `[11, 12, 22]` (sorted).
   - Right group: `[25, 64]` (sorted).

**Final Sorted Heights**: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`.

---

### Visualization in Terms of Memory
1. **Pivot Placement**:
   - The pivot divides the array into smaller subarrays.
   - No extra space is used for creating new arrays; the swaps happen in the original array.

2. **Recursive Calls**:
   - Each group (left and right) is handled separately, so memory is used for recursion.

---

### Real-Life Insight
Imagine arranging books repeatedly like this:
- Pick a reference book (pivot).
- Separate shorter and taller books.
- Repeat until every book is in its correct place.

Let’s break down **QuickSort analysis** step by step in a simple, detailed way with examples and explanations.

---

### What is QuickSort?

QuickSort is a sorting algorithm that works by:
1. Picking a **pivot** element from the array.
2. **Partitioning** the array into two groups:
   - Elements smaller than the pivot go to the left.
   - Elements larger than the pivot go to the right.
3. Recursively applying the same steps to the left and right groups until the array is sorted.

---

### Why Analyze QuickSort?

Analyzing QuickSort helps us understand:
1. **How much time it takes to sort an array** (time complexity).
2. **How much memory it uses** (space complexity).
3. **Its strengths and weaknesses** (stability, efficiency, etc.).

---

### 1. **Time Complexity**

The time complexity measures how many steps QuickSort takes to sort an array of size \(n\).

#### **Best Case: \(O(n \log n)\)**

**When does this happen?**
- The pivot divides the array into two equal (or nearly equal) parts every time.

**Example**:
Array: `[8, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4, 1]`  
1. Pick pivot: `5`.  
   - Left group: `[3, 2, 4, 1]` (smaller than `5`).
   - Right group: `[8, 7, 6]` (larger than `5`).

2. Recursively divide each group:
   - Left group `[3, 2, 4, 1]`: Pivot = `2`.
     - Left = `[1]`, Right = `[3, 4]`.
   - Right group `[8, 7, 6]`: Pivot = `7`.
     - Left = `[6]`, Right = `[8]`.

3. Combine everything in sorted order:
   - Result: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.

**Why \(O(n \log n)\)?**
- At each step, the array is divided into halves (\(\log n\) levels).
- At each level, the partitioning step processes all \(n\) elements.

---

#### **Worst Case: \(O(n^2)\)**

**When does this happen?**
- The pivot is the smallest or largest element every time.
- The array is not divided into two parts, but one part has almost all the elements.

**Example**:
Array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` (already sorted).  
1. Pick pivot: `8` (last element).  
   - Left group: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` (all elements except the pivot).
   - Right group: `[]` (no elements).

2. Recursively repeat for the left group:
   - Pivot: `7`, Left = `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, Right = `[]`.
   - This continues until the array is fully sorted.

**Why \(O(n^2)\)?**
- At each step, only one element is sorted, so there are \(n\) steps.
- Each step processes nearly all \(n\) elements.

---

#### **Average Case: \(O(n \log n)\)**

**When does this happen?**
- The pivot divides the array into reasonably balanced parts (not perfectly equal but not skewed).

**Why \(O(n \log n)\)?**
- Most of the time, the array is divided into balanced parts, resulting in \(\log n\) levels of recursion.
- Each level processes \(n\) elements.

---

### 2. **Space Complexity**

Space complexity measures how much extra memory QuickSort uses.

#### **In-Place Partitioning**:
- QuickSort doesn’t need extra arrays; it sorts the array in place by swapping elements.
- The only memory used is for the recursive calls.

#### **Worst Case**:
- In the worst case (e.g., already sorted array), the recursion depth can go up to \(n\), requiring \(O(n)\) extra space.

#### **Best/Average Case**:
- In balanced cases, the recursion depth is \(\log n\), so the space complexity is \(O(\log n)\).

---

### 3. **Stability**

QuickSort is **not stable**, meaning:
- If two elements have the same value, their relative order may not be preserved after sorting.

**Example**:
Array: `[3a, 3b, 2, 1]` (where `3a` and `3b` are identical values but from different sources).  
- After sorting, the result might be `[1, 2, 3b, 3a]` (order of `3a` and `3b` is swapped).

---

### 4. **Advantages**

1. **Fast**: On average, it’s faster than many other sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.
2. **In-Place Sorting**: Doesn’t require extra memory for new arrays.
3. **Divide and Conquer**: Breaks the problem into smaller parts, making it efficient for large datasets.

---

### 5. **Disadvantages**

1. **Worst-Case Performance**: Poor pivot selection can lead to \(O(n^2)\) performance.
2. **Not Stable**: Equal elements may not retain their relative order.
3. **Recursive Overhead**: For very large arrays, deep recursion can lead to stack overflow.

---

### Visualizing QuickSort

Imagine sorting a stack of papers by size:
1. Pick a pivot paper (e.g., a medium-sized one).
2. Divide the stack into two piles:
   - Papers smaller than the pivot.
   - Papers larger than the pivot.
3. Repeat for each pile until all papers are sorted.
