Great question! Let's compare the two codes carefully and see why **one returns `head` and the other does not**.  

---

## **🚀 Key Difference Between the Two Codes**
1. **The first code (`insertAtIndex`) returns `head` because it might modify the head pointer.**  
   - If we insert a new node **at index 0**, the `head` must change.
   - Since C passes function arguments **by value**, updating `head` inside `insertAtIndex` does not update `head` in `main`, so we must return the new `head` and assign it back.

2. **The second code (`insertAfterNode`) does not return anything because it never modifies `head`.**  
   - It only inserts a new node **after an existing node**, which does not affect the `head` pointer.
   - Since `ptr->next` is updated inside `insertAfterNode`, and `ptr` is part of the linked list, the changes are reflected globally.

### **🚀 Code Comparison Breakdown**

### **✅ First Code (`insertAtIndex`)**
```c
struct Node *insertAtIndex(struct Node *head, int data, int index)
{
    struct Node *ptr = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    struct Node *p = head; // p points to head
    int i = 0;
    
    while (i != index - 1)
    {
        p = p->next;
        i++;
    }
    
    ptr->data = data;
    ptr->next = p->next;
    p->next = ptr;

    return head;  // Necessary in case head changes
}
```
🔹 **Why does this function return `head`?**
- Suppose we insert a new node **at index 0**:
  ```c
  head = insertAtIndex(head, 10, 0);
  ```
- This means we want to insert a new node **before the first node**, which requires modifying `head`:
  ```
  [NEW] → [ 5 | ] → [ 11 | ] → [ 51 | NULL ]
    ↑
   head (changed!)
  ```
- Since `head` is a **copy** of the actual pointer, modifying it inside the function does **not** modify `head` in `main`, so we must return the new `head`.

---

### **✅ Second Code (`insertAfterNode`)**
```c
void insertAfterNode(Node *ptr, int data)
{
    if (ptr == NULL)
    {
        printf("This needs to be a valid Node!\n");
        return;
    }

    Node *p = (Node *)malloc(sizeof(Node));
    p->data = data;
    p->next = ptr->next;
    ptr->next = p;
}
```
🔹 **Why does this function NOT return `head`?**
- This function **only inserts a new node after a given node** (`ptr`).
- Since `ptr` is already inside the linked list, updating `ptr->next` **directly modifies the actual list**.
- The `head` remains the same, so there is no need to return it.

---

## **🚀 Final Summary**
| Code | Can Modify `head`? | Returns `head`? | Why? |
|------|------------------|----------------|------|
| **`insertAtIndex`** | ✅ **Yes** (if inserting at index `0`) | ✅ **Yes** | Because `head` might change. We must return the new `head`. |
| **`insertAfterNode`** | ❌ **No** | ❌ **No** | Because it only modifies `ptr->next`, which is already part of the list. `head` remains unchanged. |

### **🔹 When to Return `head`?**
- If there is a **possibility of changing the head**, return `head`.
- If modifying **internal nodes** (not `head`), returning `head` is unnecessary.
