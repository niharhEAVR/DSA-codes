The specific code `struct Node *next;` is a part of the structure definition of `Node`, which defines a pointer to the next node in the linked list. When we use `typedef` for `struct Node` as shown in your code, we define an alias `Node` that replaces the longer `struct Node`. This makes your code cleaner and shorter without altering its logic or functionality.

**Why you cannot apply `typedef` here in the middle of the structure?**

- The `typedef` declaration works for creating type aliases for a struct after or during its complete declaration, not for inline parts like an individual member (`next` in this case). It applies to the whole structure and is defined outside the structure member list.

In your context, it’s already applied at the beginning:

```c
typedef struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
} Node;
```

This ensures that all occurrences of `struct Node *next` within the structure refer to the full typedef name `Node`.

The condition `p->next != NULL` in the selected part of the code for the `insertAtLast` function is specifically used because we need to stop at the last node (the node whose `next` pointer is `NULL`). 

If we were to use the condition `p != NULL` instead, it would cause an issue:

1. **Purpose of the condition in `insertAtLast`:**  
   - The loop needs to stop at the last node because that is where the new node will be attached.  
   - If you use `p != NULL`, the loop would continue one step beyond the last valid node, attempting to access the `next` of a `NULL` pointer. This would lead to a segmentation fault (runtime error).

2. **Traversal Function `linkedListTraversal`:**  
   - In traversal, the purpose is to visit every node, including the last one. Here, the loop continues while `head != NULL`, as it processes nodes until there are none left.  
   - Accessing `head->data` and `head->next` is always valid because the condition `head != NULL` ensures the pointer is valid.

### Key Difference
- **`insertAtLast`:** Stops **before** the last node (`p->next != NULL`) because you’re modifying `p->next`.  
- **`linkedListTraversal`:** Processes **up to and including** the last node (`head != NULL`) because the data and next pointers are read-only.

This distinction ensures that operations happen within the bounds of valid memory, avoiding runtime errors.
