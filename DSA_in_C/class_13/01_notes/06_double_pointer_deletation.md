```c
void deleteFromEnd(struct Node **head)
{
    if (*head == NULL)
    {
        printf("List is empty.\n");
        return;
    }
    if ((*head)->next == NULL)
    {
        free(*head);
        *head = NULL;
        return;
    }
    struct Node *temp = *head;
    while (temp->next->next != NULL)
    {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    free(temp->next);
    temp->next = NULL;
}
```

To understand the `double pointer` (`struct Node **head`) analogy in the function `deleteFromEnd`, let’s break it down step by step. I'll provide a **visual representation** and explain **why a double pointer is necessary** in certain operations.

---

### Step 1: Double Pointer Concept
When you pass a pointer to a pointer (`struct Node **head`) to a function, you're passing the memory address of the **original pointer**. This allows the function to directly modify the pointer itself (e.g., make it `NULL`).

In the context of `deleteFromEnd`:
- `*head` points to the first node in the linked list.
- You can modify the value of `*head` (the original pointer) inside the function, which reflects in the caller (the `main` function).

---

### Visual Walkthrough of the Code:
Let’s assume the linked list looks like this:
```
[10] -> [20] -> [30] -> NULL
head
```

#### Case 1: The list is empty (`*head == NULL`):
1. If `*head` is `NULL`, there's no list to traverse. 
   - The `if (*head == NULL)` block ensures the function doesn't crash.
   - The message **"List is empty."** is printed.

---

#### Case 2: The list has only one node:
```
[10] -> NULL
head
```
1. The condition `if ((*head)->next == NULL)` checks if there's only one node.
   2. Free this node using `free(*head)`.
   3. Set `*head = NULL` to indicate the list is now empty.

The key here is that you need to update the `head` pointer in `main`, so `struct Node **head` is used.

---

#### Case 3: The list has multiple nodes:
```
[10] -> [20] -> [30] -> NULL
head
```
Let’s walk through the while loop and deletion:

1. `struct Node *temp = *head`:
   - `temp` points to the same node as `head`.
```
temp -> [10] -> [20] -> [30] -> NULL
head -> [10] -> [20] -> [30] -> NULL
```

2. `while (temp->next->next != NULL)`:
   - This loop moves `temp` to the second-to-last node (`[20]`).
```
temp -> [20] -> [30] -> NULL
```

3. `free(temp->next)`:
   - Frees the last node (`[30]`).
```
[20] -> NULL
head -> [10] -> [20] -> NULL
```

4. `temp->next = NULL`:
   - Disconnects the freed node from the list.

---

### Why Use a Double Pointer (`struct Node **head`)?
Using a single pointer (`struct Node *head`) wouldn't allow you to modify the original `head` in the caller (the `main` function). If you only use a single pointer, the modifications to `head` (like setting it to `NULL` in the case of a single-node list) would affect only the local copy inside the function.

However, with a **double pointer**:
- You modify the original `head` by dereferencing the pointer to the pointer: `*head`.
- Changes made reflect outside the function, ensuring the caller's `head` pointer gets updated.

---

### Illustration of Double Pointer Impact:
Imagine `head` in `main` is stored at address `0x100`:

1. When `deleteFromEnd` is called, a copy of the address of `head` (e.g., `0x100`) is passed as `struct Node **head`.
2. Inside `deleteFromEnd`:
   - `*head` dereferences the pointer-to-pointer, accessing the value stored in `0x100` (the address of the first node in the list).
   - You can directly change `*head` to point to `NULL` or any other node.

Without a double pointer, you'd only modify a local copy of `head`, and the original in `main` wouldn't be updated.

---

### Takeaway
The double pointer is essential to allow the function to manipulate the original `head` pointer in `main`, whether by:
1. Setting it to `NULL`.
2. Updating it to point to a new node.

Sure, let me break this down further into detailed steps and illustrate why `temp->next->next` is used instead of `temp->next`.

---

### Scenario: Deleting the Last Node
Given a linked list like this:
```
[10] -> [20] -> [30] -> NULL
head
```

To delete the **last node (`[30]`)**, we need:
1. Access to the **second-to-last node (`[20]`)**.
2. Update its `next` pointer to `NULL`, so the list becomes:
   ```
   [10] -> [20] -> NULL
   ```

---

### What Happens Inside the Loop

The code uses the condition:
```c
while (temp->next->next != NULL)
{
    temp = temp->next;
}
```

**Purpose:** This moves `temp` to the **second-to-last node**. Let's see why and how.

#### **Step-by-Step Execution**

##### **1. Initial Setup:**
- `temp` starts at `head`.
- `temp->next->next` means:  
   **Go to the next node (`temp->next`), and then check the `next` pointer of that node.**
   
Visual Representation:
```
temp -> [10] -> [20] -> [30] -> NULL
```
Here:
- `temp->next` points to `[20]`.
- `temp->next->next` points to `[30]` (which is **not** `NULL`).

---

##### **2. First Iteration:**
**Condition check: `temp->next->next != NULL`**
- `temp->next` is `[20]`.
- `temp->next->next` is `[30]`, which is not `NULL`.  
So, the loop continues, and `temp` moves to the next node.

**Update:**
```
temp -> [20] -> [30] -> NULL
```

---

##### **3. Second Iteration:**
**Condition check: `temp->next->next != NULL`**
- `temp->next` is `[30]`.
- `temp->next->next` is `NULL`.  
Now the condition fails, and the loop exits.

At this point:
- `temp` points to `[20]`, which is the second-to-last node.

---

#### **What Happens After the Loop?**
1. **Free the last node:**
   ```c
   free(temp->next);
   ```
   This deallocates the memory for `[30]`.

2. **Update the second-to-last node’s `next` pointer:**
   ```c
   temp->next = NULL;
   ```
   This makes `[20]` the new last node:
   ```
   [10] -> [20] -> NULL
   ```

---

### Why Not Use `temp->next != NULL`?

Let’s see what would happen if the condition was:
```c
while (temp->next != NULL)
{
    temp = temp->next;
}
```

#### Steps with `temp->next != NULL`:

1. `temp` starts at `[10]`.
2. Condition: `temp->next` is `[20]` (not `NULL`), so move to `[20]`.
3. Now `temp` points to `[20]`.

4. Condition: `temp->next` is `[30]` (not `NULL`), so move to `[30]`.
5. Now `temp` points to `[30]`.

6. Condition: `temp->next` is `NULL`. Loop exits.

At this point:
- `temp` points to `[30]` (the last node).
- You cannot access `[20]` (the second-to-last node).
- You lose the ability to update `[20]->next` to `NULL`.

---

### Key Difference Between Conditions

- **`temp->next->next != NULL`:** Ensures the loop stops at the second-to-last node.
- **`temp->next != NULL`:** Moves `temp` to the last node, which makes it impossible to update the `next` pointer of the second-to-last node.

---

### Visual Analogy of `temp->next->next`
Think of it like peeking two steps ahead:
1. **First Step (`temp->next`)**: The node directly after `temp`.
2. **Second Step (`temp->next->next`)**: The node after the next.

When `temp->next->next` is `NULL`, it means:
- You’re at the second-to-last node because there’s no node after `temp->next`.
