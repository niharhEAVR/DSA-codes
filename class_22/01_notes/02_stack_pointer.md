### Visualizing the Stack with a Pointer

In the stack implementation, the **pointer** is crucial for managing the stack's data and operations. Let’s break down how the pointer (`struct stack *s`) is involved in each operation, with a visualized explanation.

---

### Stack Structure

The `struct stack` contains:
- **`size`**: The maximum number of elements the stack can hold.
- **`top`**: The index of the topmost element in the stack.
- **`arr`**: A dynamically allocated array that holds the actual stack elements.

---

### Pointer Behavior

#### **1. Stack Initialization**

When you create a stack, a pointer (`s`) is allocated memory for the `struct stack`. The pointer `s` holds the address of the stack structure in memory.

```c
struct stack *s = (struct stack *)malloc(sizeof(struct stack));
```

- The pointer `s` is now pointing to a block of memory that holds the stack structure.
- Inside this block, the `size` is set to 80, `top` is initialized to -1 (indicating the stack is empty), and `arr` is allocated memory for 80 integers.

**Visualization**:

```scss
Pointer 's' -> Memory Block (struct stack)
+------------------------+
| size = 80              |   <- Stack size
| top = -1                |   <- No elements in stack yet
| arr -> [empty array]    |   <- Pointer to array of integers
+------------------------+
```

---

#### **2. Push Operation**

The `push` function adds an element to the top of the stack. The pointer `s` helps access the `arr` and `top` to perform the push.

- **Before pushing**: The `top` is `-1` (stack is empty).
- **After pushing**: The `top` is incremented, and the element is stored at the new `top` index in `arr`.

**Visualization** (pushing 10, 20, and 30):

1. **Push 10**:

```makefile
top = -1  (empty stack)
Push(10):
top = 0
arr[0] = 10
```

```scss
Pointer 's' -> Memory Block (struct stack)
+------------------------+
| size = 80              |
| top = 0                |   <- Top is now 0
| arr -> [10, empty, ...] |   <- Element 10 is at index 0
+------------------------+
```

2. **Push 20**:

```makefile
top = 0
Push(20):
top = 1
arr[1] = 20
```

```scss
Pointer 's' -> Memory Block (struct stack)
+------------------------+
| size = 80              |
| top = 1                |   <- Top is now 1
| arr -> [10, 20, ...]    |   <- Element 20 is at index 1
+------------------------+
```

3. **Push 30**:

```makefile
top = 1
Push(30):
top = 2
arr[2] = 30
```

```scss
Pointer 's' -> Memory Block (struct stack)
+------------------------+
| size = 80              |
| top = 2                |   <- Top is now 2
| arr -> [10, 20, 30, ...]|   <- Element 30 is at index 2
+------------------------+
```

---

#### **3. Peek Operation**

The `peek` function allows you to view the top element without removing it. The pointer `s` helps access the `arr` and `top` to return the element at the `top` index.

- **Peek** returns the element at `arr[top]`.

**Visualization** (peeking when `top = 2`):

```scss
Pointer 's' -> Memory Block (struct stack)
+------------------------+
| size = 80              |
| top = 2                |   <- Top is 2
| arr -> [10, 20, 30, ...]|   <- Element 30 is at index 2
+------------------------+

Peek -> arr[2] = 30  (returns 30)
```

---

#### **4. Pop Operation**

The `pop` function removes the top element from the stack. The pointer `s` helps access the `arr` and `top` to remove the element and adjust the `top` pointer.

- **Before popping**: The `top` points to the index of the most recently added element.
- **After popping**: The `top` is decremented, and the element is "removed" from the stack (though it still exists in memory, it’s no longer accessible).

**Visualization** (popping 30):

1. **Pop 30**:

```makefile
top = 2
Pop():
top = 1
arr[2] is removed (not really, but not accessible anymore)
```

```scss
Pointer 's' -> Memory Block (struct stack)
+------------------------+
| size = 80              |
| top = 1                |   <- Top is now 1
| arr -> [10, 20, empty]  |   <- Element 30 is no longer accessible
+------------------------+
```

2. **Pop 20**:

```makefile
top = 1
Pop():
top = 0
arr[1] is removed
```

```scss
Pointer 's' -> Memory Block (struct stack)
+------------------------+
| size = 80              |
| top = 0                |   <- Top is now 0
| arr -> [10, empty, ...] |   <- Element 20 is no longer accessible
+------------------------+
```

3. **Pop 10**:

```makefile
top = 0
Pop():
top = -1  (stack is now empty)
arr[0] is removed
```

```scss
Pointer 's' -> Memory Block (struct stack)
+------------------------+
| size = 80              |
| top = -1               |   <- Top is -1 (empty stack)
| arr -> [empty, ...]     |   <- All elements are removed
+------------------------+
```

### Key Concepts in the Visualization

1. **Pointer to Struct**: The pointer `s` holds the memory address of the stack structure. Through `s`, you access the stack’s properties (`size`, `top`, and `arr`).
   
2. **Dynamic Memory**: The pointer `s` dynamically allocates memory for the stack, and the array `arr` holds the actual stack elements. The pointer helps manage the memory dynamically.

3. **Top Index**: The `top` variable keeps track of the current position in the stack. It is updated on each push and pop operation.

4. **Array Access**: The pointer `s` allows you to directly access the array `arr` (the stack storage) and modify the elements based on the `top` index.

---

### Conclusion

The pointer `s` is central to managing the stack. It helps in dynamically allocating memory for the stack structure and its array, and it allows you to access and manipulate the stack's elements through the `top` index. The pointer ensures that the stack can grow and shrink as elements are pushed and popped, all while maintaining proper memory management.
