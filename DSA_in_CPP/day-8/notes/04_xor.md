> **No better approach is also thinkable that freqc is the best for finding the number, and its good solution. But how can i think of the `xor` solution, like i can still understood that xor of equal elements will be 0 and diff elements will be 1 but the problem comesn when we do coding, like how can i even use that logic to solve that issue (one way is that we have to dry run all the things previously like xor for all the numbers in the array but that is very time consuming), so in upper view how will we thinks like that if xor works for 5 elements it will surely work for huge array elements also?**

Excellent — and *very deep* question 🔥

You’ve hit the real part of learning DSA — not just *how to code a solution*, but *how to think* and *trust* a mathematical property like XOR for **any size of input**.

Let’s break it down step-by-step in a logical (and beginner-friendly) way 👇

---

## 🧠 Step 1: Why “frequency counting” feels natural

When you first see:

> “every element appears twice except one”

Your mind thinks:

> “Okay, I just need to **count** how many times each number appears — if it’s 1, that’s the answer.”

That’s a **perfectly logical** human approach.
It’s simple, direct, and guaranteed to work.
✅ But: it uses **extra space (O(n))** because you store counts.

That’s fine — it’s not wrong, just not the *most efficient*.

## ⚡ Step 2: How XOR enters the picture

Now, when you start optimizing, you ask:

> “Is there any way I can remove duplicates without using memory?”

Here’s where **bitwise logic** comes in — XOR has a **special mathematical behavior** that *acts like a perfect duplicate canceller.*

Let’s re-state the XOR properties:

1. `a ^ a = 0` → cancels same numbers
2. `a ^ 0 = a` → neutral element (0 doesn’t affect XOR)
3. XOR is **commutative** and **associative**, meaning order doesn’t matter:
   `a ^ b ^ a ^ c = b ^ c`

So, if you XOR all numbers in any order, duplicates vanish automatically.

---

## 🧩 Step 3: How we *discover* that XOR can be used

Here’s how a developer would *reason* it out in steps:

1. You notice the pattern: “pairs cancel each other out.”
2. You recall that XOR cancels equal numbers (`a ^ a = 0`).
3. You test it with 3 numbers:
   `a ^ b ^ a = (a ^ a) ^ b = 0 ^ b = b`
4. You realize — the order doesn’t matter.
   So it’ll work even if the array is shuffled.
5. Therefore, XOR-ing **all** numbers will leave **only the single one**.

At this point, it’s not about “trusting luck” — it’s **mathematically provable**.

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Why it scales to large arrays

Since XOR’s properties hold true for **every bit** independently,
it doesn’t matter if you have 5 numbers or 5 million.

Every bit position is computed separately, and duplicates will always zero out.

Let’s prove it quickly:

Say your array is:

```
nums = [x1, x1, x2, x2, x3, x3, single]
```

When you XOR all:

```
x1 ^ x1 ^ x2 ^ x2 ^ x3 ^ x3 ^ single
```

→ All pairs cancel
→ Remaining value = `single`

And because XOR is associative:

```
((((x1 ^ x1) ^ x2) ^ x2) ^ single)
= ((0 ^ 0) ^ single)
= single
```

✅ Works for *any number of elements*.

---

## 🧩 Step 5: Thinking pattern when coding

When you practice DSA more, you start thinking like this:

* “I see duplicates — can XOR cancel them?”
* “I see flipping 0 and 1 repeatedly — maybe XOR helps.”
* “I want constant space — bit tricks might be useful.”

This mental pattern comes **after you see XOR in multiple problems**:

* Missing number
* Single number
* Find two unique numbers (variation)
* Swap without a temp variable
* Check odd/even bit
* Bitmask operations

You slowly start recognizing **where XOR fits naturally.**

---

## 🧮 Step 6: Dry-running (for confidence)

Yes, at first, you *will* dry-run for 4–5 numbers manually.
But once you see it working again and again, you realize:

> XOR is a deterministic mathematical operator — not random.
> If it works for 5 numbers, it’ll work for 5 million,
> because of its fundamental **bit cancellation property**.

That’s why competitive programmers trust it instantly.

## 🧾 Summary

| Step | Thought Process                   | Key Idea                              |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1    | “Each number appears twice”       | Maybe I can cancel pairs              |
| 2    | “What cancels identical numbers?” | XOR (`a ^ a = 0`)                     |
| 3    | “Will it work for any order?”     | Yes, XOR is commutative               |
| 4    | “Do I need extra space?”          | No, just one accumulator              |
| 5    | “Can I prove it?”                 | Yes, mathematically via associativity |

## 🧠 TL;DR

You don’t “guess” XOR.
You *discover* it by asking:

> “What operation removes duplicates automatically without memory?”

And that leads to XOR —
the *pair canceller* of bitwise operations.
