## 🧠 What Is Hashing (In the Simplest Words)

Think of **hashing** like putting things into **labeled boxes** so you can **find them quickly later**.

Example idea:
You have 100 toys, and you want to find one toy later very fast.
If you just keep them in one box, you’ll have to search all 100 (slow 😩).
But if you **label boxes by toy color** (like “red box,” “blue box”), you can jump directly to the right one (fast ⚡).

That’s **hashing** — you create a **rule** (hash function) that tells **where something should go**.

---

## 🔹 Real Meaning

Hashing is a **technique to convert a value (key)** into an **index** in an array, where we’ll store or count that key.

So:

```
Key (data)  →  Hash Function  →  Index in array
```

---

## 🔹 Let’s Use Your Example

> "In an array, how many times each number is repeating"

Let’s say you have this array:

```
arr = [2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2]
```

We want to know:

```
2 → 3 times
3 → 2 times
5 → 1 time
```

Now let’s do this with **hashing logic** 👇

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Create a Hash Function

Let’s say our hash function simply uses the number itself as the index.

For simplicity:

```
hash(x) = x
```

We’ll make an array (let’s call it `hashTable`) big enough to store counts for each number.

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Counting Using Hashing

We go through each element in `arr` one by one:

| Step | Element | hash(x) | Action                | hashTable     |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| 1    | 2       | 2       | Add 1 to hashTable[2] | [0,0,1,0,0,0] |
| 2    | 3       | 3       | Add 1 to hashTable[3] | [0,0,1,1,0,0] |
| 3    | 2       | 2       | Add 1 again           | [0,0,2,1,0,0] |
| 4    | 5       | 5       | Add 1                 | [0,0,2,1,0,1] |
| 5    | 3       | 3       | Add 1 again           | [0,0,2,2,0,1] |
| 6    | 2       | 2       | Add 1 again           | [0,0,3,2,0,1] |

Now the hash table shows counts:

```
Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5
Value: 0 0 3 2 0 1
```

That means:

```
2 → 3 times
3 → 2 times
5 → 1 time
```

✅ Done!

---

## 🧩 Step 3: Why Is This Hashing?

Because:

* We used a **function** (here `hash(x) = x`) to decide **where** each number’s count should go.
* Instead of searching through the whole array every time, we **directly go to the slot** where that number’s count is stored.

So this is **hashing in action** — mapping data to a position for **fast access**.

## 🧠 In Simple Words:

| Without Hashing                           | With Hashing                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| You check every element manually to count | You directly update count at `hash[x]` |
| Slow                                      | Very fast                              |
| Need multiple loops                       | One loop                               |
| No index mapping                          | Smart index mapping via hash function  |

---

## 💻 C++ Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[] = {2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2};
    int n = 6;

    vector<int> hash(10, 0); // hash array (size 10 for simplicity)

    // Counting frequency
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        hash[arr[i]]++; // hash[arr[i]] means count of that number
    }

    // Display results
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (hash[i] > 0) {
            cout << i << " occurs " << hash[i] << " times" << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

🧾 **Output:**

```
2 occurs 3 times
3 occurs 2 times
5 occurs 1 times
```

Let’s go step-by-step through what happens **inside the computer’s memory** when we write:

```cpp
hash[arr[i]]++;
```

---

## 🧠 Step 1: What’s in Memory?

Let’s take the same example:

```cpp
int arr[] = {2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2};
vector<int> hash(10, 0);
```

Here’s what memory roughly looks like before we start:

```
arr:  [2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2]
index   0  1  2  3  4  5

hash: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
index  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
```

Both are stored in **contiguous memory blocks** (continuous slots in RAM).

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: How `hash[arr[i]]++` Works Internally

Now let’s say we are processing the first element:

### 🔸 i = 0 → arr[i] = 2

→ The expression `hash[arr[i]]` becomes `hash[2]`.

Here’s what happens:

1. **CPU reads `arr[i]`**

   * `arr[0]` is `2`.

2. **It plugs that into the hash array’s index**

   * `hash[2]` means "go to the memory slot number 2 in the hash array".

3. **CPU calculates the exact memory address**

   * If `hash` starts at memory address, say `1000`,
     and each integer takes 4 bytes,

     ```
     hash[2] = 1000 + (2 × 4) = 1008
     ```

     → CPU jumps directly to that location.

4. **Increment that value**

   * Originally `hash[2] = 0`
   * After increment: `hash[2] = 1`

✅ Done — it didn’t check any other index. It *jumped directly* to the memory cell for that number.

---

## ⚡ Step 3: Continue the Loop

| Step | i | arr[i] | hash index | action | hash array            |
| ---- | - | ------ | ---------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| 1    | 0 | 2      | hash[2]++  | 0→1    | [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] |
| 2    | 1 | 3      | hash[3]++  | 0→1    | [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] |
| 3    | 2 | 2      | hash[2]++  | 1→2    | [0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] |
| 4    | 3 | 5      | hash[5]++  | 0→1    | [0,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0] |
| 5    | 4 | 3      | hash[3]++  | 1→2    | [0,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0] |
| 6    | 5 | 2      | hash[2]++  | 2→3    | [0,0,3,2,0,1,0,0,0,0] |

At the end:

```
hash[2] = 3
hash[3] = 2
hash[5] = 1
```

So:

```
2 → 3 times
3 → 2 times
5 → 1 time
```

---

## 🧩 Step 4: Why Is This So Fast?

Because **each lookup or update** (like `hash[x]++`) is an **O(1)** operation —
it goes *straight* to the correct memory address.

Compare that to a normal search:

* Without hashing, you’d need to loop through every element to count.
* With hashing, each update goes **directly** to the right slot.

That’s why hashing is used everywhere — like in **maps**, **sets**, and **database indexing**.

---

## 🔍 Visualization

Here’s a visual idea of what’s happening:

```
arr[i] → hash index → memory slot → increment

  2     →   [2]     → hash[2] = hash[2] + 1
  3     →   [3]     → hash[3] = hash[3] + 1
  5     →   [5]     → hash[5] = hash[5] + 1
```

Each number *instantly knows where to go* — like having its own personal locker 🔢.

---

## 🧠 Recap (In One Line)

> **Hashing lets you jump directly to where a value belongs in memory — no searching needed.**

That’s why:

* Searching, inserting, and deleting become **super fast (O(1))**.
* It’s widely used in **hash tables**, **maps**, **sets**, and **frequency counting** problems.
