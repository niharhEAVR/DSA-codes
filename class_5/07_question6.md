Let's analyze the **time complexity** of the given code snippet.

### **Code Analysis**
```c
int isPrime(int n)
{
    for (int i = 2; i * i < 10000; i++)   // Loop with a fixed upper limit
    {
        if (n % i == 0)   // Check if n is divisible by i
        {
            return 0;   // Return 0 if n is divisible by i (n is not prime)
        }
    }
 
    return 1;   // Return 1 if no divisors were found (n is prime)
}
isPrime();
```

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

1. **For Loop:**
   - The loop runs from \( i = 2 \) to \( i \times i < 10000 \). 
   - This means the loop continues as long as \( i \) is less than \( \sqrt{10000} = 100 \).
   - Therefore, the loop runs a fixed number of times, specifically **100 times** (from \( i = 2 \) to \( i = 99 \)).

2. **Constant Time Operations:**
   - Inside the loop, the `n % i` operation checks if \( n \) is divisible by \( i \), which is a constant-time operation, \( O(1) \).
   - The loop runs at most 100 iterations, so each iteration performs a constant-time operation.

3. **Termination:**
   - If \( n \) is divisible by any \( i \), the function returns 0 immediately, which is a constant-time operation.
   - If no divisors are found, the function returns 1, which is also a constant-time operation.

### **Time Complexity Analysis:**
- The loop runs **100 times** regardless of the input \( n \), because the upper bound of the loop is fixed at \( i \times i < 10000 \).
- Since the number of iterations is constant (100), the overall time complexity of the function is **constant time**, \( O(1) \).

### **Final Answer:**
The **time complexity** of the `isPrime` function is \( O(1) \), because the loop runs a fixed number of times (100 iterations), and this number does not depend on the input value \( n \).

### **Explanation in Simple Terms:**
- The loop in this function runs a fixed number of times (100), so no matter how large or small the number \( n \) is, the function will always take the same amount of time to execute.
- This makes the function's time complexity constant, \( O(1) \).
