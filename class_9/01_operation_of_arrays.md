In the context of arrays, the following operations are commonly performed:

1. **Traversal**: 
   - This operation involves visiting each element of the array once to perform a certain task, such as printing the elements or performing calculations.
   - Example: Looping through the array to display its elements.

2. **Insertion**:
   - Insertion is the process of adding a new element to the array. This can be done at various positions, such as at the beginning, middle, or end of the array.
   - Example: Adding an element to the end of the array or at a specific index.

3. **Deletion**:
   - Deletion involves removing an element from the array. After deletion, the remaining elements are shifted to fill the gap.
   - Example: Removing an element from a specific index in the array.

4. **Searching**:
   - Searching refers to finding a specific element within the array. It can be done through methods like linear search (checking each element one by one) or binary search (for sorted arrays).
   - Example: Finding if a particular number exists in the array.

Each of these operations is fundamental to working with arrays and is used in various algorithms and applications.
