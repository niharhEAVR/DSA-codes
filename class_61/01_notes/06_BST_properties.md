Let's break down these concepts in more detail:

### **1. Searching in a Binary Search Tree (BST)**

In a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**, each node follows this property:
- The **left child**'s value is **less than** the parent node.
- The **right child**'s value is **greater than** the parent node.

The **searching** process takes advantage of this property.

#### **Search Function:**
- We start at the **root** node and compare the target value with the current node's value.
  - If the target value is **equal** to the current node's value, we've found the node, and we return it.
  - If the target value is **smaller** than the current node's value, we move to the **left subtree** (because all values in the left subtree are smaller).
  - If the target value is **larger** than the current node's value, we move to the **right subtree** (because all values in the right subtree are larger).
  
We keep doing this recursively until we either:
- Find the target node.
- Reach a `NULL` node, meaning the target value isn't in the tree.

### **Example:**
Let's say we have the following BST:

```
         50
       /    \
      30     70
     / \    /  \
    20  40 60   80
```

To search for `40`:
- Start at `50`: `40` is smaller than `50`, so move to the left subtree (`30`).
- At `30`: `40` is greater than `30`, so move to the right subtree (`40`).
- At `40`: We find the target value, so we return the node.

### **2. Inorder Traversal of a BST**

In an **inorder traversal**, the nodes are visited in the following order:
- **Left subtree** → **Root node** → **Right subtree**

For a **BST**, this traversal results in the nodes being visited in **ascending order** of their values. This is because:
- The left subtree contains values smaller than the root.
- The right subtree contains values larger than the root.

#### **Inorder Traversal Function:**
- We first recursively visit the **left subtree**.
- Then, we **visit** the current node (process its value).
- Finally, we recursively visit the **right subtree**.

### **Example:**
For the tree:

```
         50
       /    \
      30     70
     / \    /  \
    20  40 60   80
```

The **inorder traversal** would visit the nodes in this order:
- Left subtree of `50`: Visit `20`, then `30`, then `40`.
- Visit `50`.
- Right subtree of `50`: Visit `60`, then `70`, then `80`.

Thus, the output of the inorder traversal would be:
```
20 30 40 50 60 70 80
```

### **3. Deleting a Node from a BST**

Deleting a node from a BST is a bit more involved because we need to maintain the BST properties after the deletion. There are three cases to consider when deleting a node:

#### **Case 1: The node is a leaf (no children)**
- If the node has no children (it is a leaf node), we can simply **remove** it from the tree by setting its parent’s pointer to `NULL`.

#### **Case 2: The node has one child**
- If the node has only one child (either left or right), we **replace** the node with its child. This preserves the BST structure because the child is still in the correct position in the tree.

#### **Case 3: The node has two children**
- If the node has two children, we need to find a replacement for the node that still satisfies the BST property. The most common approach is to find the **inorder successor** (or **inorder predecessor**) of the node:
  - The **inorder successor** is the **smallest node** in the right subtree of the node to be deleted.
  - The **inorder predecessor** is the **largest node** in the left subtree of the node to be deleted.
  
  After finding the inorder successor (or predecessor), we replace the node to be deleted with the inorder successor (or predecessor) and then delete the inorder successor (or predecessor), which will always fall into one of the first two cases (leaf or one child).

### **Example:**
Consider deleting the node `30` from the following tree:

```
         50
       /    \
      30     70
     / \    /  \
    20  40 60   80
```

- **Node `30`** has two children (`20` and `40`).
- The **inorder successor** of `30` is `40` (the smallest node in the right subtree of `30`).
- We replace `30` with `40`.
- Now, we delete `40`, which is a leaf node, so we simply remove it.

After deletion, the tree looks like this:

```
         50
       /    \
      40     70
     /      /  \
    20     60   80
```

### **Code Explanation (in the context of the previous code)**

- **Search**: The `search` function compares the target value with the current node's value. If it matches, it returns the node. If not, it recursively searches the left or right subtree based on whether the target is smaller or larger than the current node.
  
- **Inorder Traversal**: The `inorderTraversal` function recursively traverses the left subtree, visits the current node, and then traverses the right subtree. This ensures the values are printed in ascending order for a BST.

- **Delete Node**: The `deleteNode` function handles the three cases:
  1. If the node is a leaf, it simply frees the node.
  2. If the node has one child, it returns the child node to its parent.
  3. If the node has two children, it finds the inorder successor, copies its value to the node, and deletes the inorder successor recursively.

### **Conclusion**

- **Searching**: We use the BST property to quickly find the target node by comparing values and moving left or right.
- **Inorder Traversal**: This traversal visits nodes in ascending order, which is a key property of BSTs.
- **Deletion**: Deletion involves three cases, and when a node has two children, we replace it with its inorder successor to maintain the BST structure.
